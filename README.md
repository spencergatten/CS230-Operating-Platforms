# CS230-Operating-Platforms


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
    The gaming room wanted to build a multi-platform game called "Draw it or Lose it" in which players and teams try to guess the picture while it was being         drawn in order to score points. The client was the gaming room and I worked for CTS (Creative Technology Solutions) 
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    I did a good job finding specific tools to design this game and making very specific recommendations. 
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    
    Working through a design document added perspective to the code. In some cases, it just gave me that "aha!" moment that I needed in order to write the code     correctly
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    
    I received an A on the final assignment so I don't think I would revise any of it. I worked on it hard. 
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into the software design using design constraints. These a very specific rules that the code must           follow.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    When my code didn't work I sought out tutoring. This proved to be a highly effective strategy as I learned what not to do. I am now a large proponent of         object oriented programming.
